# 🚀 Ethereum Wallet — Decentralized Application (dApp) with React & Smart Contracts

## 🔍 What This Project Is

This project is a fully functional Ethereum Wallet built as a decentralized application (dApp) using:

- **React** for the frontend user interface  
- **Tailwind CSS** for sleek styling  
- **Hardhat** for smart contract development, testing, and deployment  
- **Metamask** for secure wallet connectivity and transaction signing  
- Integration with the **Goerli test network** and **Ganache** for local blockchain simulation  

The wallet allows users to send and receive Ethereum test tokens, interact with deployed smart contracts, and manage crypto assets securely — all within an intuitive web interface.
